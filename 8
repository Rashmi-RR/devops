Title Slide

Project Name (e.g., Universal Alert Database)

Your Name

Date

1️⃣ Introduction

Purpose: Automate fetching Dynatrace problems and store in PostgreSQL for analytics.

Reduces manual alert tracking.

Supports faster incident management.



---

2️⃣ Tools & Technologies

Dynatrace (Problem API)

PostgreSQL (Database storage)

Python (Requests, psycopg2)

Postman (API testing)

Windows / CyberArk (Execution environment)



---

3️⃣ Project Workflow

1️⃣ Fetch problems from Dynatrace using API.
2️⃣ Filter problems by management zones.
3️⃣ Insert relevant problem data into PostgreSQL.
4️⃣ Enable future trend & predictive analysis dashboards.


---

4️⃣ Fetching Problems from Dynatrace

Using mTLS and API token for authentication.

REST API call with filtered management zones (Transcom, GTMatch, Optimus, Sierra).

Collected:

Problem ID

Title

Impact Level

Start Time

End Time

Status




---

5️⃣ Storing into PostgreSQL

Designed schema:

problem_id (PK)

title

impact_level

start_time

end_time

status


Inserted fetched problems for persistent storage and querying.



---

6️⃣ Challenges Faced

mTLS certificate handling and path issues.

API 400 Bad Request debugging.

Identifying correct Dynatrace endpoints.

Token handling without UI generation.

SSO & access restrictions while testing APIs.



---

7️⃣ Current Status

✅ Successfully fetching problems from Dynatrace.
✅ Storing problems into PostgreSQL automatically.
✅ Verified correctness with sample queries.


---

8️⃣ Next Steps

Create dashboards for trend analysis (Grafana / Power BI).

Automate periodic fetch using cron / Task Scheduler.

Build alert classification and predictive analysis pipeline.

Integrate with monitoring teams for daily operational usage.



---

9️⃣ Demo Plan (Tomorrow)

Show Python script fetching live problems.

Show insertion into PostgreSQL (select * from problems;).

Demonstrate structure for future dashboards.



---

10️⃣ Q&A

“Happy to take your questions.”
